## 📖 Abstract

**Nir** (meaning 'water') is a holistic, community-led ecosystem designed to tackle the severe water crisis in the Barind region of Bangladesh. [cite_start]We successfully integrate multiple high-potential water solutions into a single cohesive project[cite: 14].

Our solution combines household-level water supply (Module 1) with agricultural-level management (Module 2), all connected via the **Nir Smart App**. [cite_start]This system aims to empower local communities—especially women—reduce groundwater extraction, and foster sustainable water practices[cite: 15, 16].

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Nir operates on a **Hybrid Model** connecting three core pillars:

1.  [cite_start]**Diversified Water Sources:** Rainwater Harvesting, Fog Nets, Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG), and Greywater Recycling[cite: 43].
2.  [cite_start]**Sustainable Agriculture:** Smart ponds, river water supply, and drought-tolerant crops[cite: 44].
3.  [cite_start]**Digital Backbone:** A smart mobile application acting as the central nervous system for monitoring and engagement[cite: 33].

## 📱 The "Nir" Smart App

The app connects households, farmers, local government, and NGOs.

### 🔹 Features for Households
* [cite_start]**Real-time Dashboard:** Monitor local water availability and weather alerts[cite: 77].
* [cite_start]**System Requests:** Request installation for Rainwater Harvesting (RWH), AWG, or Fog Harvesting systems[cite: 81].
* [cite_start]**Smart Monitoring:** IoT-based tracking of RWH tank levels[cite: 84].
* [cite_start]**Greywater Tutorials:** Guides on recycling household water for gardening[cite: 86].

### 🔹 Features for Farmers
* [cite_start]**Pond Calculator:** An interactive map tool that calculates the optimal size and location for digging ponds based on land topography[cite: 181].
* [cite_start]**On-Demand River Water:** A "Water-as-a-Service" feature to request surface water delivery, reducing aquifer dependency[cite: 191].
* [cite_start]**Knowledge Base:** Information on drought-resistant crops (e.g., BINA-19, BRRI dhan56) and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) methods[cite: 202, 204].

### 🏆 Exclusive Feature: "Jol Joddha" (Water Warrior)
A gamification campaign to drive behavioral change.
* **Act:** Users log water-saving actions (e.g., cleaning a pond, using greywater).
* **Share:** Upload photos to the app.
* [cite_start]**Earn:** Gain points, unlock badges, and climb the village leaderboard [cite: 209-214].

## 🛠️ Hardware Modules

### Module 1: Household Water Security
Designed to provide year-round water and reduce the burden on women.
* [cite_start]**Rainwater Harvesting (RWH):** Rooftop catchment with low-cost filtration (biosand)[cite: 101, 102].
* [cite_start]**Fog Harvesting:** Polypropylene mesh nets installed in highlands to trap fog droplets (150-750L/day potential) [cite: 127-129].
* [cite_start]**Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG):** Solar-powered community units condensing moisture from humid air ($25-32^{\circ}C$, 70-75% RH)[cite: 154].
* [cite_start]**Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR):** A dual-system collecting RWH overflow and filtered greywater to recharge the groundwater table [cite: 167-169].

### Module 2: Agricultural Water Security
[cite_start]Targeting the 90.6% reliance on groundwater for irrigation in the Barind region[cite: 177].
* [cite_start]**Khari Revival:** Re-excavating traditional canals and ponds for surface water storage[cite: 183].
* [cite_start]**River Water Supply:** A logistics network connecting farmers to nearby river sources via water entrepreneurs[cite: 193].

## 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

* [cite_start]**Phase 1: Pilot (Months 1-6)** Implementation in 3-5 villages with 50 RWH units, 2 AWG units, and the Beta app launch[cite: 219].
* [cite_start]**Phase 2: Scale (Months 7-18)** Expansion to 20 villages, introduction of fog harvesting, and full "Jol Joddha" integration[cite: 222].
* [cite_start]**Phase 3: Regional Expansion (Months 19-36)** Coverage of the entire Barind region and national scale-up preparation[cite: 225].
